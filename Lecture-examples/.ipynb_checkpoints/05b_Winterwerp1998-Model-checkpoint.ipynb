    "**Overview of the W98 model:** The W98 model is an ODE which defines the rate change in floc size, $dD_f/dt$, as being equal to the rate of aggregation, $A$, minus the rate of breakup, $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dD_f}{dt}=A-B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $D_f$ is the mean floc diameter, $A$ is the floc aggregation rate [L/t], and $B$ is the floc breakup rate [L/t]. Solution to the equation yields $D_f$ as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The floc aggregation rate, $A$, is modeled in the formulation using collision theory in a turbulent environment for particles *smaller* than the Kolmogorov micro length scale; for reference, at $G=35$ s$^{-1}$, $\\eta\\approx 180$ $\\mu$m. The aggregation model assumes that there is no loss of suspended sediment and that the total number of primary particles remains constant during the process of flocculation. Based on this, the resulting aggregation term is,\n",

    "A=K_{a}^{'}\\frac{{D_{p}}^{n_{f}-3}}{n_{f}\\rho _{s}}GCD^{4-n_{f}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_{p}$ is the primary particle size, $n_{f}$ is the fractal dimension, $\\rho _{s}$ is the sediment density, $G$ is the turbulent shear rate, $C$ is the sediment concentration [g/l], and $K_{a}^{'}$ is the collision efficiency coefficient that accounts for the fact that not all collisions result in aggregation. $K_{a}^{'}$ is an empirical coefficient that needs to be calibrated for each suspension of mud. The Winterwerp formulation for $B$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B=K_{b}^{'}\\frac{{D_{p}}^{-p}}{n_{f}}\\left ( \\frac{\\mu }{F_{y}} \\right )^{q}G^{q+1}\\left ( D-D_{p} \\right )^{p}D^{2q+1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the dynamic fluid viscosity, $F_{y}$ is the floc strength $[N]$, $K_{b}^{'}$ is the breakup coefficient, and $p$ and $q$ are coefficients. In the model, $F_{y}$ and $K_{b}^{'}$ are functions of the sediment and water physico-chemical properties that need to be empirically determined. Winterwerp suggests $p=3-n_{f}$ and $q$ to be 0.5, respectively, with $F_{y} = 10^{-10}$ N for estuarine flocs.\n",
